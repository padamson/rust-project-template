## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `dependabot.yml`: a commented `directories:` example on the cargo entry, for repos whose excluded crates commit their own `Cargo.lock` (Dependabot reads only the root lock otherwise)
- `.config/nextest.toml`: slow-timeout and leak-timeout in every profile, retries only under `[profile.ci]` (which CI now runs), a commented test-group example; every CI job carries `timeout-minutes`
- `.cargo/mutants.toml` ships live instead of as an `.example`, so a fresh clone never runs mutation testing unscoped under `cargo test`
- Seed crate rewritten as claim-shaped tests: `classify` returns a `Size` enum with a boundary at the threshold and a `SizeError::Negative` variant carrying the count; the threshold reads the environment through an injected lookup; `tests/common/mod.rs` ships a `TempDir`-owning `Workspace` fixture and a bounded `poll_until`; one `#[ignore = "..."]` test shows the gate for anything a fresh clone may lack. `tempfile` as a dev-dependency
- Doctest policy: `cargo test --doc` always runs, and the crate keeps at least one doctest so the step is honest
- CLAUDE.md "Tests" section with the shapes and the runner policy
- `scripts/mutants.sh` creates its scratch diff under `$TMPDIR` with a full template; `mktemp -t` ignores `$TMPDIR` on macOS and fails under the Claude Code sandbox
- `release.yml` publishes to crates.io with Trusted Publishing (OIDC via `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action`); the token-missing skip and the `continue-on-error` on the publish step are gone, since both made a failed publish look green. SETUP.md walks through the crates.io publisher entry
- `advisory-monitor.yml`: daily `cargo deny check advisories`, opening one tracking issue on a new advisory and closing it when the tree is clean; the report reaches the issue body through an env var, not string interpolation
- `cargo audit` removed from CI and the hooks: `cargo deny check` reads the same advisory database, so `deny.toml`'s `[advisories] ignore` is the single list and nothing mirrors it. `Security Audit` leaves the required checks
- Every action in every workflow pinned to a commit SHA with the version in a trailing comment (Dependabot keeps them current); workflow permissions default to `contents: read` and each writing job names what it writes
- `.github/actions/diff-base`: one composite action giving the mutation and skill-guard jobs the PR base branch's current tip, the push's previous tip, or nothing on a first push
- Agent skill scaffold: `skills/my-project/` with `references/`, hidden from installers by `metadata.internal: true` until shipped; `scripts/check-skill-version-bumped.sh` as a pre-commit hook and a `Skill version guard` CI job; the `npx skills add` block plus skills.sh badge in README.md. SETUP.md says how to ship it (with the in-repo symlink as an opt-in for crates that use themselves) or remove it
- Consumed agent skills: `.agents/` and `.claude/skills/` gitignored, and a CLAUDE.md section on `npx skills add` installs and refreshes
- Tracked `.claude/settings.json` with the Claude Code sandbox block (loopback network, configd Mach lookup, excluded commands for git, gh, nextest, cargo run, prek, the mutants and ci-watch scripts)
- `scripts/ci-watch.sh` streams job results for a commit until every run finishes, with a CLAUDE.md section
- CLAUDE.md states the sandbox is on for every repo and cross-repo writes are not allowed; SETUP.md says `prek install` writes `.git/hooks` and is run by hand once per clone
- Dual license, `MIT OR Apache-2.0`: `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`, `Cargo.toml` and README updated
- SETUP.md: keeping `target/` under control (cargo-sweep, turning incremental off, build-script assets outside `OUT_DIR` with their own CI cache), converting to a workspace, and a `build.rs` recipe so `--version` reports the build commit off a release tag
- Pre-commit: a comment by the nextest hook stating that the hook's feature set must equal the union of CI's, and a commented `exclude:` for byte-exact fixture directories on the whitespace hooks
- `security.yml`: a commented resolve-then-`--rev` recipe for installing a tool from a git branch
- `scripts/mutants.sh` diffs a root commit against git's empty tree, so `Mutation Testing (diff)` tests the initial scaffold instead of failing with exit 128 on a repo's first push; a user-supplied base ref that does not resolve is now a hard error rather than a silent pass
- `scripts/mutants.sh --working` diffs uncommitted edits against `HEAD` (or a given ref), for gating a change before it is committed
- `scripts/mutants.sh` passes `--no-renames` to `git diff`, so a `git mv` produces a mutable diff instead of a green gate over unmutated code
- Pre-commit `cargo vet` hook: `files` regex now matches paths under `supply-chain/` (the end-anchored pattern matched nothing), and the hook skips until `cargo vet init` has run, mirroring the CI job
- `deny.toml`: `allow-wildcard-paths = true`, so versionless path deps of `publish = false` workspace members and dev-dependencies do not trip `wildcards = "deny"`
- CLAUDE.md: `--working` usage, the `-f <file>` trap, and the one-run-at-a-time rule for `mutants.out/`
- `Supply Chain Review` job checks for `supply-chain/audits.toml` before installing cargo-vet, so an uninitialized repo skips in seconds instead of building the tool first
- `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`: enables squash auto-merge on every Dependabot PR; the required status checks are the whole gate, since merges made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` trigger no push run on `main`
- Dependabot `cooldown` (7/14/7/3 days for cargo, 7 for actions) so bumps arrive after the cargo-vet import sets have audited them
- Dependabot groups for majors and for actions, plus a commented git-dependencies slot that must come first, so the weekly run opens at most four PRs and the auto-merge cascade (N PRs, O(N^2) CI runs) cannot start
- SETUP.md: require every PR-triggered job including `Mutation Testing (diff)`, and leave "require branches to be up to date" off, with the reasoning for both
- Initial project scaffold
- `.cargo/mutants.toml` with scoping guidance to keep `cargo mutants` runs tractable on real downstreams: `.cargo/` is the one path cargo-mutants reads (a root `.mutants.toml` is ignored silently) and the header says how to verify the config is live; `test_workspace = true` and no `--lib`, which skipped `tests/` integration targets and let cross-target kills survive; a commented nextest filterset as the speed lever and a commented `exclude_globs` for codegen output
- `test.yml` split: ubuntu-only `Lint` job covers fmt, clippy, doctest, and `cargo doc`; the cross-platform matrix (ubuntu/macos/windows) runs only `cargo build` + `cargo nextest run`
- Comments in `security.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and `deny.toml` documenting the `cargo audit --ignore` pattern keyed off `deny.toml`'s `[advisories] ignore` as source of truth
- CLAUDE.md / SETUP.md note on `prek install --overwrite` to avoid double-firing legacy pre-commit hooks
- MSRV-job comment on stubbing `include_bytes!` build artifacts via `touch` for downstreams that embed generated files
- Expanded `cargo vet import` list in SETUP.md to the seven well-known trusted orgs (bytecode-alliance, embark-studios, fermyon, google, isrg, mozilla, zcash), using the named-import form
- Per-PR workflow documentation in SETUP.md for handling Supply Chain Review failures on Dependabot PRs (never auto-regenerate exemptions in CI; certify vs. regenerate vs. reject)
- `cargo vet trust` section in SETUP.md covering transitive trust of publishers already certified by imported orgs (seanmonstar, BurntSushi, epage, kennykerr, Lokathor), including `--allow-multiple-publishers` guidance for flagship multi-maintainer packages
- `scripts/mutants.sh` wrapper for `cargo mutants --in-diff`, with project-specific pre-setup placeholder, defaulting to `HEAD~1..HEAD`
- Two-job mutation-testing setup in `security.yml`: a per-push/PR `mutation-testing-diff` job using `cargo mutants --in-diff` (typical runtime seconds-to-minutes), with `fetch-depth: 0` and PR/push base resolution; and a `mutation-testing` (full) job available via manual `workflow_dispatch` only — full-codebase runs don't scale to be scheduled
- `## Mutation testing` section in CLAUDE.md covering the local script + CI shape
- `/mutants.out/` and `/mutants.out.old/` added to `.gitignore`
- All Cargo cache steps in `test.yml`, `release.yml`, and `security.yml` switched from `actions/cache@v5` + manual key composition to `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` + `shared-key`. Auto-derived key includes the rustc version (catches stale-binary panics across toolchain bumps), and pre-save cleanup keeps cache size in check. Release-job `shared-key` includes `matrix.target` so the two macOS cross-targets don't clobber each other.
