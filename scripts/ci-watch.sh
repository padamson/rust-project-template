#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Stream GitHub Actions results for one commit: one line per job as it
# reaches a terminal state, one line per workflow when it finishes, then
# exit. Built to be driven by an agent's background monitor, but it reads
# fine in a terminal too.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/ci-watch.sh                 # the current HEAD
#   ./scripts/ci-watch.sh <sha|ref>       # a specific commit
#   POLL=15 ./scripts/ci-watch.sh         # override the 30s poll interval
#   TIMEOUT=600 ./scripts/ci-watch.sh     # give up after 10 minutes
#
# Why this is a script and not a loop written inline:
#
# The Claude Code sandbox matches `excludedCommands` against the top-level
# command line. `gh` on its own is excluded and works; `gh` inside a `for`
# or `while` loop is NOT matched, so the whole invocation stays sandboxed
# and every call fails on the read-denied ~/.config/gh -- silently, if the
# loop swallows errors. Excluding this script instead unsandboxes the whole
# process tree, and the `gh` it spawns inherits that, the same route
# `git push` takes for SSH. `.claude/settings.json` carries the exclusion.
#
# Every terminal state is reported, not just successes: a silent watcher
# looks identical to a passing one, which is the failure mode this replaces.
